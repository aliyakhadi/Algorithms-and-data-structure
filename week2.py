# The time complexity is O(n*target) in worst case but it should still work fast for large n if nums[i] will ve in  a short range
# Memory complexity is 101*4 + n*4 bytes -> O(n)
# I think this is better than two nested 'for' loops but I don't know how to make it faster

# yes, it seems that the time complexity is not linear. We still can use sorting and save indexes in pairs
